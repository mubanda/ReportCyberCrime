        This is a temporaray activity so that we can all have our section to
        work with without depending on someone elses section to vist our own
        when testing.
        The reason for this is that lets say we didnt do this
        it would mean everyone would need depend on someone elses screen
        to get to theirs when testing so if theyre making changes and lets
        say they remove their buttons then another person wont be able to
        get to their section because their are no buttons to get to it. (e.g,
        the sign in button stops working in the sign in page which is the first
        page, everyone else working on the main menu/report forms/settings etc
        would be stuck and unable to test).
        Once we have all finished as much as we can without depending on each
        other we'll link it all together and put pages we're they're supposed
        to be.
